minimal but working mail list manager

## A few words at the start
The history of this MLM (mail list manager) starts from 90-s. Volodymyr Litovka created MLM with Perl without any external libraries. When I needed an MLM, I tried it, but as time passed, it could not correctly parse mail headers and work with utf-8. So I rewrote the old code with the help of sundry libraries but kept the logic of the code and config file. Of course, I extended the config file but kept backward compatibility and minimalist can work with the old config.

The MLM is really minimal. There is no web interface and many other features. But it still is powerful enough and easy to install and use.
